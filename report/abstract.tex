\textbf{\textit{Abstract--}}\textbf{This paper presents a novel approach to simulating the evolution of artificial 2D plant morphologies using L-systems, focusing on expanding beyond traditional tree structures to explore alternative forms such as serpinski and dragon curves. Inspired by evolutionary hypotheses on plant development, we employ a genetic algorithm with a fitness function tailored to simulate the factors influencing plant evolution. Our system allows interactive selection, empowering users to guide simulated evolution toward desired phenotypes. Through experimentation, we demonstrate the efficacy of evolutionary algorithms in optimizing L-systems, showcasing their potential in diverse applications such as gaming and architectural design. By extending the scope of L-system exploration, our research contributes to both the understanding of natural phenomena and the generation of novel structures, underscoring the versatility of L-systems in artificial evolution studies.}
